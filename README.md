The University of Maryland's CALCE (Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering) offers publicly accessible lithium-ion battery datasets, including data from various battery models such as CS2-35, CS2-36, CS2-37, and CS2-38. These datasets encompass a range of experimental conditions, including full and partial cycling, storage tests, dynamic driving profiles, open-circuit voltage measurements, and impedance measurements. The batteries tested include different form factors (cylindrical, pouch, prismatic) and chemistries (LCO, LFP, NMC), providing a comprehensive resource for research and development in battery performance and degradation studies.
You can access these datasets and related information through the CALCE Battery Data Portal:
